About me:
  I am a Librarian working with makerspace technology in the US. After working with it for a few months, I feel like I need to do something different with my career. I am looking to switch into a CS field, most likely software engineering. I think I love being able to create and manipualte programs, but it has been a while since I made them. I mainly have felt disjointed from my current job and want to participate in something more worthwhile, and the other prospects in libraririanship do not interest me. I feel like switching to a CS carer would allow me to be on the cutting edge of new trends and leading the charge towrds a better, more interesting future (as corny as that is).  Here's to hoping I am not wasting my time!
